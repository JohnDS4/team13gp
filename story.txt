In courtyard need to find Gaius
Ask about the castle
Soldier Thomas will help you if given gold
Tells you Gaius is wizard in great hall
Go to wizard, he is hungover and will not talk
Go to catherine and ask for help
She will help you if you can solve a riddle
When you solve the riddle, she gives you some ingredients, tells you to mix them in a container full of water
Two containers available; the goblet and the old boot. Goblet is obvious one to choose but will be refused by wizard
When you have a container you need to fill it with water first which means using it on the water fountain in the courtyard
Then you must use the ingredients with the container full of water to create the hangover cure
If you use the old boot as the container, the wizard will accept it and drink the cure
The wizard will then become lucid and help you
He tells you that it is not safe to talk in the great hall and says for you to talk in the anteroom
Go to the anteroom and talk to the wizard again, he will tell you he is being conspired against and you need a special item to be named later
He says the item is behind the painting in the room, which has a code inside that needs to be solved
When you examine the painting it shows a circle with a clue inside and a code to be deciphered on the outside
Use the nearby dial to point to each letter in the right order to enter the code
When correct the painting opens up and reveals the Time Turner which when used with people you can see their past
The exits of the room are then sealed, the only way to escape is to use the time turner on the wizard
When you do this the wizard's memory shows that he has given a bottle of poison to a woman in the throne room, in the background there is a painting of that woman
He then says "you only have 2 uses left. What will you do with this memory?" and vanishes, unlocking the door at the same time
Then you need to go out and get the poison by going to the throne room, the description of the great hall has changed, the servants are setting up for a banquet
Also mentioned is the painting seen in the wizard's memory
When you examine the painting, a bottle of poison falls to the floor

You must then walk about the castle and use the time turner on 2 more people and decide who you are going to target

You then must take the bottle to the great hall and choose whos drink to use the bottle on 

Use lady:
Stabbed by soldier game over

Use viceroy:
murdered by guards game over

Use king:
Trigger fight scene with viceroy when he tries to claim throne

Then you must play the fight game, if you win you win the game
